* Create 4C map to deliver the desired outcomes by
  * Creating and refining activities to establish connections with the topic and between the learners.
  * Creating and refining both topics to discuss in concepts (what they need to know) and additional materials (what they would like to know as well).
  * Creating and refining the plan on how to deliver the topics during the concept phase utilizing the "six trumps".
  * Creating and refining the concrete practice activity.
